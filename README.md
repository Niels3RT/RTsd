# RTsd
FPV race timing system.

# ATTENTION
This repository as well as the whole project are still works in progress and i'm only human, so expect mistakes and errors.

Please be patient :)

# Features
-4 channels  
-around 40kHz sampling rate per channel  
-all channels are sampled simultaneously, at the same clock edges  
-all sampling, timing, peak detection etc. are done in an FPGA (right now a Xilinx Spartan6 XC6SLX16)  
-WiFi, HTTP server and race housekeeping are done by a ESP32 (ESP32-WROVER-IB module)  
-WiFi works as Access Point or connects to existing network  
-both communicate via an SPI interface with each other  
-ui is in javascript, so smartphone, tablet, computer can be used to control racing  
-a result viewer (html/javascript) for smart tv etc. is included  
-all race/configuration data is saved to sd card, device dependend data (rx module calibration) to esp nv storage  
-as long as the sd card is intact, all other devices can be changed during a race (think of water, fire)  
-all rx5808 modules (i have seen..) are supported (rssi to 1.xV and 3.xV)  
-rssi data is saved and reprocessed in realtime whenever results are requested  
-integrated power supply, just connect lipo (i used 12V/3s for development, 2s/4s *should* work too but untested)  
-simple, easy to use ui  

Please be aware that the fpga firmware is only provided as binary and NOT under GPL-3.0 license, see /fpga/ directory for info.


# Videos
Some (rather ugly and old) videos recorded during development, top one is the oldest.  
Klick screenshots to watch on youtube:

1. Running a heat and switching control device while flying, result viewer on right side.

2. Testing race control, exceptions, switching devices (well, browser..), race control on right side.

# Programming the Xilinx Spartan6 board

This is by far the saddest part of the whole project. Writing the firmware itself is pretty straight forward and a matter of a few clicks. But obtaining the
the tools needed from Xilinx and getting them to run on Windows 10 is not.  

[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMEIPCjqinA) is a nice youtube video on what to download and how to install. To get the download you have to register with Xilinx and
download a couple of GB. In theory a WebPack license will suffice and you only need the Lab Tools installed for the Impact tool.  

! More details will follow, for now just a short walkthrough on where to click when.

In Impact start a new project, let it handle a project file automagically, configure devices using Boundary-Scan, don't assign configuration files right now.  
Right click in the main window and initialize chain.  
Right click on the Xilinx chip and add SPI/BPI flash.  
Choose provided MCS file, select SPI PROM and M25P80, leave data width at 1.  
Left click on the Flash chip above the Xilinx one.  
In the lower left half of the window, double click on program, leave all options as they are.  
Done, one led should be blinking once per second and one led should slowly light up/get darker.  


# Programming the ESP32

1. Install Python and esptool.  
Windows users see [here](https://cyberblogspot.com/how-to-install-esptool-on-windows-10/).  
On Mac and Linux it *should* work the same way, install Python then esptool (pip?).

Write binaries to the ESP32: Just connect the ftdi to the header on the pcb, change com port to your needs and run command to start flashing.  

![ESP32 FTDI connected](pics/esp_ftdi_small.png?raw=true "ESP32 FTDI connected")

```
esptool -p com6 -b 460800 --before=default_reset --after=hard_reset write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 40m --flash_size 2MB 0x8000 partition-table.bin 0x1000 bootloader.bin 0x10000 trackerAP.bin
```


# Preparing the micro SD-Card

Format card with a FAT derivative, copy the contents of /sd_card/ to the card. The "sd_card_root_here.txt" should be in the root of the filesystem.  

Copy the contents of /html/ to the card /RTsd/http  

Look at the .txt files in RTsd directory and adapt to your preferences.  

Go racing :)
